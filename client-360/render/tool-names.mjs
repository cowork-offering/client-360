// Release gate: every Customer 360 tool name mentioned in the plugin's agent and skill prose must
// exist in the org's McpServerDefinition manifest.
//
// The prose is what a banker's session runs on. A tool name that drifted, was renamed in the org, or
// was typed from memory produces a call that fails at the connector with nothing useful to say. This
// diffs the prose against the manifest so the drift is caught at release time instead.
//
// Run directly for a readable report:   node client-360/render/tool-names.mjs
// Run as a test:                        node --test client-360/render/tool-names.test.mjs
//
// Requires the repo checkout: the manifest lives outside the shipped plugin folder.

 *   - a second-hop completion tool, `complete_` followed by lowercase snake_case. Today that is
 *     `complete_new_facility_detail` alone: nCino creates the Loan Detail from an after-commit flow
 *     of its own, so the field it carries cannot be set in the transaction that files the facility.
 *     Without this alternative the name is invisible to the scanner, and a tool the org ships reads
 *     as "declared but never mentioned" however carefully the prose names it.
 * Deliberately narrow. Plan step ids (`held_execution`, `write_assessment_0`), org field names
 * (`LLC_BI__Status__c`) and host tools (`create_artifact`) do not match, and must not: this gate
 * checks names that MUST be manifest tools, not every identifier in the prose.
